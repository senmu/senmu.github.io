        <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/joulee&quot;&gt;Julie Zhuo&lt;/a&gt;’s post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/write-in-2016-938f569b535e#.epf5p9xgf&quot;&gt;writing and
wanting others to write more&lt;/a&gt;, 
I’m making another attempt to get back into writing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to migrate old posts over and continue maintaining all that
baggage, I’m starting over with a clean slate (especially considering that the
technical posts I wrote years ago are no longer relevant today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be better at writing on a regular basis, but then for the last 5 or
so years, I just stopped. Perhaps I thought that I had nothing to share. Then I 
read this Dostoyevksy quote from Julie’s post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“But how could you live and have no story to tell?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a quote that made me realize that everyone has something to share. On a
daily basis, I’m learning plenty of new things in software development, cooking,
and one of my new hobbies: hand lettering – and I think these are all 
interesting things that are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
