## Hi, I'm Sam!

Many moons ago I turned coffee into some sort of combination of PHP, HTML, CSS,
and JS. These days, I'm slinging around [Swift](http://swift.org) and
occasionally, Objective-C, to develop iOS apps at [Robots &
Pencils](http://www.robotsandpencils.com).

Besides software development, I love travelling, eating new cuisine, and play 
LW for my ice hockey beer league team.
