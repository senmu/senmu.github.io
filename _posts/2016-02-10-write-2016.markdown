Inspired by [Julie Zhuo](http://twitter.com/joulee)'s post on [writing and
wanting others to write more](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/write-in-2016-938f569b535e#.epf5p9xgf), 
I'm making another attempt to get back into writing again.

Rather than try to migrate old posts over and continue maintaining all that
baggage, I'm starting over with a clean slate (especially considering that the
technical posts I wrote years ago are no longer relevant today).

I used to be better at writing on a more regular basis, then for the last 5 or
so years, I just stopped. Perhaps I thought that I had nothing to share. Then I 
read this Dostoyevksy quote from Julie's post:

> "But how could you live and have no story to tell?"

It's a quote that made me realize that everyone has something to share. On a
daily basis, I'm learning plenty of new things in software development, cooking,
and one of my new hobbies: hand lettering â€“ and I think these are all 
interesting things that are worth sharing.
